"""He'll give you a series of strings (containing only non-numerical characters) followed
by non-negative numbers (N), e.g., "a3". You need to convert the letters to uppercase for
each string and print it repeatedly N times on the console. In the example, you need to write back "AAA".
First, on the output, you should print a statistic of the number of unique symbols used
 (case-insensitive) in the format: "Unique symbols used {0}".

Next, print the rage message itself.
The strings and numbers will not be separated by anything. The input will always start with a
non-numeric symbol, and for each string, there will be a corresponding number. The input will
be given on a single line.

Input
路 The input data should be read from the console.
路 It consists of a single line holding a series of string-number sequences.
路 The input data will always be valid. There is no need to check it explicitly.

Output
路 The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of exactly two lines:
o On the first line, print the number of unique symbols used in the message in the format described above.
o On the second line, print the rage message."""
