"""Create a class Movie. The __init__ method should receive a name and a director. It should also have a default value
of an attribute called watched set to False. There should also be a class attribute __watched_movies which will keep
track of the number of all the watched movies. The class should have the following methods:

路 change_name(new_name: str) - changes the name of the movie
路 change_director(new_director: str) - changes the director of the movie
路 watch() - change the watched attribute to True and increase the total watched movies class attribute
(if the movie is not already watched)
路 __repr__() - returns "Movie name: {name}; Movie director: {director}. Total watched movies: {__watched_movies}"""
